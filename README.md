<b>B. Problem:</b><br/>
As web software developers, our job is to automate web experience to make web users's life easier. But what about the life of ourselves: the web developer's own life: how much do we apply the same automation back to our own coding?<br/> 
For example, why do we need to repeat coding/maintain similar page over and over? Let's take a concrete case on forms, views used to collect user inputs. Forms are one of most frequently used views in web applications. Forms are very similar: they contain fields, styles, and related functions like loading, submission, validation and son on. Since all related functions can be shared so coding a form mainly is coding similar html tags and style them.<br/><br/>
But <b>why do we need to hard coding the html tags ourselve instead of automating them?</b> 

<b>C. Solution:</b><br/>
We should think about coding a form in a different way: form info (form schema) such as fields and styles are data to be consumed by form renderer so that is no coding to build a form. Instead, the job of engineers is to provide form info (form schema) to the form renderer and the rest is the form renderer's job to show the view.
